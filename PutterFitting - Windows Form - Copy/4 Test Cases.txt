Thought the building process I had five people test it to see if they could get errors

1)
Found error in new account setup, that broke when bad dates were passed in
Found titles were missing.
Found that null options could be selected causes run time errors

2)
Found same errors in new account setup with incorrect dates
Found that login would accept any two parameters next to each other in file (first name, last name; instead of username, password)

3)
Found errors in change password, would not save handicaps
Found errors in switching users

4)
Found if the file is moved from the initial folder, lots of runtime errors (no solution for this yet)
Also found error were admin can delete themself, causes runtime errors when they try to add themself back, without restarting program(no solution for this)

5)
Did not find any runtime errors, but suggested that the new person setup was hard to find.


For my testing I tried to run through all the uses, and see if anything did not work. To start I loaded the application. From the main screen there are 4/5 branches.
1) Change Password
	From this screen there are two possible options:
	1) Reset Password
		This will continue to check for correct information until it is found. When found it load the main login screen again.
	2) Home
		This will load the main login screen again.

2) Login as Guest
	This will load the fitting screen with 3 options:
	1) Change Password
		This is locked to the guest, and when clicked a message box pops up saying "Cannot Change Password".
	2) Home
		This loads the main fitting screen for the guest again.
	3) Next
		This loads the next set of choices for the user until it completion. From this screen there are four new options, with the next option being removed.
		1) Show details
			Shows the details of a putter if one is selected, otherwise it does nothing.
		2) My Details
			Shows the details of what putter fits the user, and if a putter is selected, compares it to the selected putter showing a percent match.
		3) Start Over

		4) Sign Out

3/4) Create new user, 
	(There is a button for this, or any new username entered in. Two branches to the same screen.)
	This loads a screen to add a new user. It has nine fields: username, password, handicap, first name, last name, birthdate, credit card number, ccv2 code, and expiration date. The username, birthdate, cc#, ccv2, and expiration date all have error handling to insure proper information is passed in. From this screen there is two additional options:

Going through all the possible options I found the following logic errors:
5-1-4-3-1 found error in accepting already existing username (fixed)
3/4 and 5 found error in wrong label for username text box (fixed)
5-2-3-1-2 found error were user can enter in multiple blank lines of text and program crashes (fixed)
All the above have been fixed, and I am confident in saying that all intended uses of the program will not causes errors. 
The only two errors that I am aware of that haven't been fixed are the two that my friend found (4). While I would prefer to have no errors, both of them are not common, and shouldn't ever arise in standard uses of the program.
